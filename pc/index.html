<h2>Details</h2>

<p>For each component I&rsquo;ve added a small Q&amp;A about why that specific thing, if you have more questions on my choices, feel
  free to message me on Discord or write me an e-mail.</p>

<h3>CPU</h3>

<p>The CPU I&rsquo;ve chosen is an <a
  href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/190884/intel-core-i59600kf-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz/specifications.html">Intel Core

  <li>No integrated GPU</li>
</ul>


<h4>Q&amp;A:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Why Intel?

    <ul>
      <li>At the time when I was building my PC, Intel CPUs were more expensive than AMD CPUs, but the motherboards where the
        other way around. Resulting in a very similar price for either one. I had always used Intel-based builds up to then,
        so I was slightly biased for it already. Combined with a poor experience with an AMD-based HP laptop I decided to go
        with Intel.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why specifically i5-9600KF?

    <ul>
      <li>The i5-9600 is still one of the best price-to-performance 9th gen Intel CPUs, and might still be a very good
        candidate for the LGA1151 socket. F (required discrete graphics) - due to cost reduction and already having a
        dedicated GPU at the time (GTX 1050ti), K (unlocked) - because that&rsquo;s what was available.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do I plan to switch to AMD?

    <ul>
      <li>I definitely do consider it, but currently have no real preference for either (2022-08-22).</li>
      <li>I&rsquo;m pretty sure whenever DDR5 RAM is mainstream and worth upgrading to, I&rsquo;ll be choosing to switch to AMD (2023-05-22).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>GPU</h3>

<p>The GPU I currently have is a GIGABYTE branded GeForce RTX 3070.
  Specifically <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3070GAMING-OC-8GD-rev-20">GeForce RTX 3070 GAMING OC 8G (rev 2.0)</a></p>

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why GeForce?

    <ul>
      <li>Not much to say here, in my opinion AMD GPUs are nowhere near as good (or maybe popular) as GeForce ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why the RTX 3070?

    <ul>
      <li>It was a price and performance balance in my case: while I don&rsquo;t need much rendering power on a daily basis, I do
        have two large monitors and I tend to game at 1440p. From my research the 3060 would have entirely satisfied me if
        I didn&rsquo;t want to run the two monitors in conjunction with my VR headset&hellip; The 3070 felt like a nice balance with
        not costing too much and delivering enough graphical power for all my needs. And anything above seemed like overkill.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why GIGABYTE?

    <ul>
      <li>I really like the GPUs backplate design, and also that&rsquo;s what you see the most (if the card is horizontally
        installed).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What before?

    <ul>
      <li>As stated on the top, I built my PC at 2020Q1, before the RTX 30-series were even announced. At the time of building
        I had a GTX 1050 ti (also GIGABYTE branded), but that now lives in my bother&rsquo;s PC, as it&rsquo;s a low profile card and my
        brothers PC is also low-profile. Between the 1050 and my current 3070 I used a GTX 970 which I bought from a family
        friend&hellip;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>RAM</h3>

<p>I have 32 GB total ram, on 2 identical sticks of 16 GB. They&rsquo;re HyperX Predator, but it seems that Kingston has
  rebranded them to be called <a href="https://www.kingston.com/unitedkingdom/en/memory/gaming/kingston-fury-renegade-ddr4-memory">Kingston FURY Renegade</a>.
  Specifically I chose 16GB DDR4-2666 CL13. And yes, they&rsquo;re installed in parallel to allow dual-channel.</p>

<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Why 2 * 16GB?

    <ul>
      <li>I started out with just a single 16 GB stick, but as time went on I started to realize that I&rsquo;d benefit from an
        extra 16 GB.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why not 4 * 8GB?

    <ul>
      <li>Easy: the motherboard I have does not have quad-channel RAM and 16 GB is cheaper than 2 * 8 GB.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why 2666 MHz?

    <ul>
      <li>From what I read at the time Intel, unlike AMD, does not benefit from RAM that&rsquo;s clocked above the CPU&rsquo;s max RAM
        speed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why CL-13?

    <ul>
      <li>The CAS Latency was actually the main thing I was looking at when searching from RAM. As the previous answer states,
        Intel has no benefits for RAM speeds above 2666 (in my case), so I went for the 2nd best thing: CL speed. The RAM I
        found usually had CL-16, but I managed to spot the HyperX Predator variant with CL-13. I have no idea if it would
        even make a difference between CL-13 and CL-18 in my build, but as it didn&rsquo;t incur much extra cost, I decided: why
        not?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Motherboard</h3>

<p>When looking for base parts for my build back in 2020Q3, I for some reason decided that I <em>needed</em> a USB-C port. In my
  searches a motherboard kept popping up that was both cheap, and had a USB-C port. So I ended up getting it.
  It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Motherboard/Z390-M-rev-10">GIGABYTE Z390</a> which features the following nice-to-haves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Micro ATX form factor</li>
  <li>2 NVMe slots for 22110/2280 M.2 SSDs</li>
  <li>reinforced PCIe slot</li>
  <li>extensive BIOS with fan control options</li>
  <li>M.2 socket for an Intel CNVi wireless module (which I&rsquo;ve been planning on installing for about 1.5 years now)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Do I like it?

    <ul>
      <li>I don&rsquo;t hate it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>PSU</h3>

<p>I went all out on the PSU and ended up with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210518105638/https://www.nzxt.com/products/e650">NZXT E650</a>,
  which seems to have been rebranded to the <a href="https://nzxt.com/product/c650">NZXT C650</a>. It&rsquo;s a modular, 80+ gold rated PSU.
  Weirdly enough, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the loudest component in my PC case&hellip;</p>

<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Why 650 W?

    <ul>
      <li>When doing calculations about potential power usage, the number I came up with was around 600.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why modular?

    <ul>
      <li>I dislike clutter in my PC case!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why 80+ gold rated?

    <ul>
      <li>I care about the environment and my power bills!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why not twice as cheap 80+ bronze PSU?

    <ul>
      <li>I really hope that this PSU outlives my PC by a lot. I could not rely on a cheap PSU to not fail on me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Before starting this PC building process I had already owned a Samsung? 240 GB SATA SSD. Since I wanted an upgrade, I
  decided to get a NVMe M.2 SSD. Comparing spec sheets and prices I ended up with
  <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/SSD/GIGABYTE-NVMe-SSD-1TB">GIGABYTE NVMe SSD 1TB</a> (yes, I too was surprised it&rsquo;s called just
  that)</p>

<p>As I acquired more files (as one does) I started to feel a need for extra storage space. An HDD is a very convenient
  solution to this problem. I have a <a href="https://www.seagate.com/gb/en/products/hard-drives/barracuda-hard-drive/">Seagate BarraCuda 4TB</a>,
  5400 rpm. It&rsquo;s quiet, it&rsquo;s cheap
  <del>and I need to pray to it every night, so it doesn&rsquo;t spontaneously die.</del>
</p>

<h3>Case</h3>

<p>For my fancy new computer parts I decided that I want a fancy new computer case. Of the multitude of options I most
  liked the <a href="https://lian-li.com/product/lancool-ii/">LIAN LI Lancool-II</a> for it&rsquo;s very pretty design and zero effort
  cable management solutions.</p>

<h3>Cooling</h3>

<p>CPU cooler: some off-brand cheapo tower cooler (don&rsquo;t have the box anymore)<br />
  Fans: 3 * Xilence<br />
  Airflow direction: Front to back<br />
  Airflow pressure: Positive pressure: 2 in, 1 out</p>
